Pro Whey 500g &#43; Pro Leucine 500g Bundle Core Range from CNP From cnpprofessional.co.uk
Exercise itself can deplete your body’s amino acid stores. However, leucine supplementation (200 mg/kg bodyweight) 50 minutes before anaerobic running exercise had no effect on performance. Take 2.5 g of leucine (or 5 g of bcaa) 30 minutes before training to support the anabolic stimulus. I usually do bcaa�s in the morning, pre, post, and before bed.
