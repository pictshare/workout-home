<p>Since maximum force cannot be developed with fast movements, any increase in the rate of force developed in the early phase of contraction becomes vital. Explosive strength is defined as the rate of force development (rfd) at the onset of contraction.[4] They create the best opportunity to increase force and velocity in the same exercise. “maximal strength training improves work economy, rate of force development and maximal strength more than conventional strength training.”</p>
