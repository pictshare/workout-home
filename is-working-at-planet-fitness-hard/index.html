The brand of the machines is life fitness, and i found a life fitness connect app on the google play store but it would not connect to the machines. They provide a comfortable and convenient service to get you to sign up, but discourage any real working out. Another thing i noticed is that the atmosphere there is pretty bland, people just walking on treadmill or elliptical.</p>
