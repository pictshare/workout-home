Gym in Thornton, CO 880 E 104th Ave Fitness From planetfitness.com
Recently joined planet fitness, was discouraged to get into the gym because i haven’t worked out in a long time but i started at 330&#43; pounds and i’m down to 305ish i feel great, my energy levels are up and i can already see a huge improvement. Also the question is, how do i get the fitness widget on my apple watch? You can obtain a planet fitness guest pass by tagging along with a friend, family member, or someone else who has a black card. Tap my watch, then tap wallet &amp; apple pay.
