You can still get into a costco and checkout with an expired membership but at the cashier you�ll just have to tell them to put the renewal fee on your bill. 24 hour fitness is no longer accepting membership certificates purchased from costco. Costco reserves the right to refuse membership to any applicant and membership may be terminated at costco’s discretion without cause, as well as for such things as failure to comply with these conditions and regulations or abuse of your membership privileges. According to 24 hour fitness, they’re no longer accepting costco vouches and advised anyone who still has one that hasn’t been redeemed yet to return it.

<p>24 hour fitness is no longer accepting membership certificates purchased from costco. Membership is available to qualifying individuals 18 years of age or older. I was reading that costco backdates membership renewal, so for example if your membership were to expire june 1st, and you paid the 55$ for renewal on july 1st, you�d be paying full price for 11 months (it still expires june 1st the following year).
