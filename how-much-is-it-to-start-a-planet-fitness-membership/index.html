You don’t need to buy the big equipment you see in planet fitness. The values found here may vary from one location to another but these just show you a rough estimate on the fees you have to pay for a planet fitness membership. Fitness club members often find themselves paying the yearly and monthly fees without actually going to the gym. Be aware that you must be a member of a black card and not just the basic membership.
