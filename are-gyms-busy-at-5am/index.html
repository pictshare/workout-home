Barbell Routine For A Busy Gym YouTube From youtube.com
So recently, because of work, i�ve had to attend the gym in the evening meaning it�s usually quite busy until about 8/9pm. Is la fitness busy at 5am? Yoga, stretch or a general warm up. I�ve found that my workouts have suffered as a result, mainly because i�m struggling to get on equipment, but also because people come to the gym at 6pm and use 4 sets of dumbbells at once, and the same with supersetting equipment.
