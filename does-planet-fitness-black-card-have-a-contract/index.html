Your membership card can’t be used by anyone else. That means you’ll pay extra for tanning beds, massage chairs and more. Most of them have very nice massage chairs which are actually really good for working out sore muscles and backs after working out. Often, planet fitness black card memberships come with a contract, usually of 12 months.
