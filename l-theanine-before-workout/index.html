Caffeine &#43; LTheanine From revlabs.com
My theanine capsules are 200 mg though and i typically take 200 mg caffeine. No extra jitters, no extra nervousness. Theanine is extremely rare in nature and it is found almost exclusively in green tea. I’m going to try 75mg/50mg/25mg to see if any of those doses will give me enough of a boost but not so much of an effect after.
