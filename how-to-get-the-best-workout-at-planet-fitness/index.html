5x10 is an excellent wake up call, and the heavier percentages of beefcake compared to traditional bbb absolutely push the trainee hard enough that they’re gonna need to eat big to recover. It’s in you to feel your best. For the most part, this workout routine is perfect for any beginner, especially if you’re looking for gains and strength. Starting off with bbb beefcake does a great job of getting you acclimatized to higher volume work if you’ve been staying low volume.
