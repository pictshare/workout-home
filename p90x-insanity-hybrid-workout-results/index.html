InsanityX, P90X/Insanity hybrid workout schedule. p90x insanity From pinterest.co.uk
Hi guys, i�ve been looking at both the p90x and insanity workouts. I was getting stronger, eating better, lost. If you are done with the basic p90x workout program and are looking for something extra try adding insanity workout schedule to it. Ok, so i’ve finally made my decision on what i’m going to do when i finish my second round of the p90x workout.
