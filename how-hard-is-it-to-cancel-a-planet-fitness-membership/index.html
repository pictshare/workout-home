3 Ways to Cancel Fitness Membership wikiHow From wikihow.com
While we hate to see you cancel your membership, our cancellation process may vary from club to club, so the best way to begin the cancellation process is to contact your home club location to confirm the cancellation policy. You can sign up for a planet fitness membership through their website or app, in under 5 min, without speaking with a representative. Gyms are notoriously hard to cancel with all around. To cancel however, you must either go in person to the gym you signed up at (remember some people may move to other areas of the country) or go through the mail.
