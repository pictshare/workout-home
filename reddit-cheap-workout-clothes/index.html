It’s the shirt that tons of boxes print their shirts on and sell them for $25. Also looking for recommendations for shirts and shoes. So ayun, you can buy both cheap clothes and kinda more expensive ones just to test em out and see what u like better. Also great shirts but i personally prefer how the next level brand fits.
