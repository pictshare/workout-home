Richmond, IN Fitness From planetfitness.com
The way i like to train is not. Planet fitness memberships are always $10 a month, or $19.99 a month for the pf black card®. I have the $20/mo version and shower there almost exclusively on my travels. Well, the $10 monthly memberships are definitely for real, though there are a few things to be aware of before you sign up.
