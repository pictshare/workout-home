<p>It absolutely works, and in my personal (anecdotal) experience, packs on strength much faster than just blasinting your bodyparts to bits every time on a 4 or 5 day bodypart split. Regardless of the the type of training you do, the key to a great workout is progressive resistance. Keep repeating this for four months in order to reach the point where you are doing.
